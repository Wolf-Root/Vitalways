This project is an elegant, high-performance **landing page for a modern beverage concept**. The primary goal was to create an immersive visual experience that highlights the **craftsmanship and quality** of non-alcoholic drinks (mocktails).

It serves as a demonstration of advanced frontend techniques, particularly:

- **Complex GSAP ScrollTrigger animations** for sections like the ingredients reveal.
- **Perfect responsive design** tailored for modern devices.
- **Seamless integration** between **Tailwind CSS** utilities and **MUI** components.

The project is **FrontEnd only** and focuses purely on the presentation layer.
